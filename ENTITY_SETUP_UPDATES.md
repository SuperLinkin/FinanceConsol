## 📋 Change Details

### 1. Entity Type Dropdown - Renamed ✅

**Old Options:**
- Parent
- Parent + Subsidiary
- Subsidiary
- Joint Venture
- Associate
- Branch

**New Options:**
- **Ultimate Parent** (renamed from "Parent")
- **Parent** (renamed from "Parent + Subsidiary")
- Subsidiary
- Joint Venture
- Associate
- Branch

**Rationale:**
- "Ultimate Parent" clearly indicates top-level entity with no parent
- "Parent" now means any entity that has both a parent AND subsidiaries (mid-tier)
- Simpler and easier to understand

---

### 2. Optional Fields ✅

**Made Non-Mandatory:**
- ❌ Region (removed asterisk)
- ❌ Country of Incorporation (removed asterisk)
- ✅ Tax Jurisdiction (already optional)

**Still Mandatory:**
- ✅ Entity Code
- ✅ Entity Name
- ✅ Entity Type
- ✅ Functional Currency
- ✅ Ownership %
- ✅ Financial Year End
- ✅ Status

---

### 3. Financial Year End Format ✅

**Old Format:** Full date (e.g., `2024-12-31`)
**New Format:** Month-end only (e.g., `31-Dec`)

**Dropdown Options:**
- 31-Jan
- 28-Feb
- 31-Mar
- 30-Apr
- 31-May
- 30-Jun
- 31-Jul
- 31-Aug
- 30-Sep
- 31-Oct
- 30-Nov
- 31-Dec

**Why?**
- Simpler for users
- Year is not needed (entities typically follow same year-end annually)
- Less data entry errors
- International format (DD-MMM)

---

### 4. Split Ownership Feature ✅

**New Feature:** Support for entities with multiple parent entities

**How It Works:**
1. User checks **"Split Ownership"** checkbox
2. Form expands to show:
   - Parent Entity 2 dropdown
   - Ownership % by Parent 2 field
3. Original parent becomes "Parent 1"
4. System saves both parent relationships

**Use Cases:**
- Joint Ventures with 2+ partners
- 50/50 ownership scenarios
- Complex group structures

**UI Features:**
- ✅ Blue highlighted checkbox with description
- ✅ Conditional fields (only show when checked)
- ✅ Ownership % labels change to "by Parent 1" and "by Parent 2"
- ✅ Parent 2 dropdown excludes Parent 1 (no duplicates)
- ✅ Required validation when split ownership enabled

**Database Fields Added:**
```sql
split_ownership BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
parent_entity_id_2 UUID REFERENCES entities(id)
ownership_percentage_2 DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 0
```

**Example:**
```
Joint Venture Ltd
├── 50% owned by Company A (Parent 1)
└── 50% owned by Company B (Parent 2)
```

**Important:** Split ownership is **NOT available via Excel upload** - it must be configured through the UI form only.

### 5. Excel Template Updated ✅

**New Template Structure:**
- Updated Financial Year End format: `31-Dec` instead of `2024-12-31`
- Updated Entity Type values: `Ultimate Parent` and `Parent`
- 3 example rows showing hierarchy:
  1. **PARENT01** - Ultimate Parent (top of group)
  2. **MID001** - Parent (mid-tier, has parent above and subsidiaries below)
  3. **SUB001** - Subsidiary (bottom tier)

**Template Columns (14 total):**
1. Entity Code
2. Entity Name
3. Parent Entity Code
4. Ownership %
5. Entity Type
6. Functional Currency
7. Presentation Currency
8. Region (optional)
9. Country (optional)
10. Tax Jurisdiction (optional)
11. Financial Year End (31-Dec format)
12. Status
13. Include in Consolidation
14. Notes

## 🗄️ Database Schema Changes

### Original Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE entities (
  ...
  parent_entity_id UUID,
  ownership_percentage DECIMAL(5, 2),
  ...
);
```

### Updated Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE entities (
  ...
  parent_entity_id UUID,
  ownership_percentage DECIMAL(5, 2),
  split_ownership BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  parent_entity_id_2 UUID REFERENCES entities(id),
  ownership_percentage_2 DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  ...
);
```

### Migration Options:

**Option 1: Fresh Setup (New Database)**
```sql
-- Use the updated schema file
\i 01_COMPLETE_DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql
\i 02_SEED_DATA.sql
```

**Option 2: Existing Database**
```sql
-- Run migration script to add new fields
\i 03_ADD_SPLIT_OWNERSHIP.sql
```

The migration script (`03_ADD_SPLIT_OWNERSHIP.sql`) adds:
- `split_ownership` column
- `parent_entity_id_2` column
- `ownership_percentage_2` column
- Index on `parent_entity_id_2`
- Column comments for documentation

## 🎨 UI Changes

### Form Layout:

**Before Split Ownership:**
```
[Entity Code]           [Entity Type]
[Entity Name (full width)]
[Parent Entity]         [Ownership %]
[Functional Currency]   [Presentation Currency]
...
```

**After Checking Split Ownership:**
```
[Entity Code]           [Entity Type]
[Entity Name (full width)]
[Parent Entity]         [Ownership % (by Parent 1)]

[✓ Split Ownership - Blue box (full width)]

[Parent Entity 2]       [Ownership % (by Parent 2)]
[Functional Currency]   [Presentation Currency]
...
```

### Visual Indicators:
- ✅ Blue highlighted checkbox area
- ✅ Helper text explaining split ownership
- ✅ Smooth expand/collapse animation
- ✅ Required field validation for Parent 2 fields
- ✅ Labels update dynamically ("Ownership %" → "Ownership % (by Parent 1)")
