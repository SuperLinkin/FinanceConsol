## 🗄️ Database Schema

### New Table: `entity_controllers`

```sql
CREATE TABLE entity_controllers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  role VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Entity Controller',
  reporting_to UUID REFERENCES entity_controllers(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  is_ultimate_owner BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Key Fields:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `name` | VARCHAR(255) | Full name of controller |
| `email` | VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE | Email address (must be unique) |
| `role` | VARCHAR(100) | One of: Owner, Manager, Group Controller, Entity Controller |
| `reporting_to` | UUID (FK) | References another controller this person reports to |
| `is_ultimate_owner` | BOOLEAN | True if this is the ultimate owner/boss |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | Active/Inactive status |

### Self-Referencing Foreign Key:
- `reporting_to` references `entity_controllers(id)`
- Allows building unlimited depth hierarchy
- ON DELETE SET NULL (if manager deleted, reporting link is removed)

### Indexes Created:
```sql
idx_entity_controllers_reporting_to  -- Fast hierarchy lookups
idx_entity_controllers_role          -- Filter by role
idx_entity_controllers_ultimate      -- Find ultimate owner quickly
```

## 🔍 Validation Rules

### Required Fields:
- ✅ Name (always required)
- ✅ Email (always required)
- ✅ Role (always required)
- ✅ Reporting To (required UNLESS Ultimate Owner is checked)

### Business Logic:
1. **Ultimate Owner = true**
   - `reporting_to` must be NULL
   - Cannot report to anyone
   - Typically only one person should have this

2. **Ultimate Owner = false**
   - `reporting_to` is REQUIRED
   - Must select a manager/supervisor

3. **Email Uniqueness**
   - Each email can only be used once
   - Database constraint enforces this

4. **Circular References**
   - System allows but should be avoided
   - Example: A reports to B, B reports to A (bad!)
   - UI doesn't prevent this yet (could add validation)

## 📊 Example Data

### Sample Controllers Table:

| Name | Role | Reporting To | Is Ultimate Owner |
|------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| John Smith | Owner | NULL | ✓ true |
| Jane Doe | Manager | John Smith | false |
| Michael Johnson | Group Controller | Jane Doe | false |
| Sarah Williams | Group Controller | Jane Doe | false |
| Alice Chen | Entity Controller | Michael Johnson | false |
| Bob Lee | Entity Controller | Michael Johnson | false |

### Hierarchy Visualization:

```
John Smith (Owner) ★ Ultimate Owner
    │
    └── Jane Doe (Manager)
            ├── Michael Johnson (Group Controller)
            │       ├── Alice Chen (Entity Controller)
            │       └── Bob Lee (Entity Controller)
            │
            └── Sarah Williams (Group Controller)
                    ├── Carlos Garcia (Entity Controller)
                    └── Diana Patel (Entity Controller)
```

## 🚀 Migration Steps

### For New Installations:
```sql
-- Just run the updated schema
\i 01_COMPLETE_DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql
\i 02_SEED_DATA.sql
```

### For Existing Installations:
```sql
-- Run migration script
\i 04_CREATE_ENTITY_CONTROLLERS.sql
```

The migration script:
1. Creates `entity_controllers` table if not exists
2. Adds all indexes
3. Enables RLS (Row Level Security)
4. Adds column comments
5. Creates default policy

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality:
- [ ] Can add controller with Ultimate Owner checked
- [ ] "Reporting To" is disabled when Ultimate Owner checked
- [ ] "Reporting To" is enabled when Ultimate Owner unchecked
- [ ] Red asterisk (*) shows on "Reporting To" when required
- [ ] Can select existing controller from "Reporting To" dropdown
- [ ] Form validates required fields
- [ ] Email uniqueness is enforced

### Hierarchy Testing:
- [ ] Can create 1-level hierarchy (just Ultimate Owner)
- [ ] Can create 2-level hierarchy (Owner → Manager)
- [ ] Can create 3-level hierarchy (Owner → Manager → Group Controller)
- [ ] Can create 4-level hierarchy (Owner → Manager → GC → Entity Controller)
- [ ] Multiple Group Controllers can report to same Manager
- [ ] Multiple Entity Controllers can report to same Group Controller

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Cannot add duplicate email
- [ ] Can have multiple Ultimate Owners (system allows but not recommended)
- [ ] Deleting a manager doesn't delete their reports (reports just lose the link)
- [ ] Inactive controllers still show in dropdown (system behavior)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Ultimate Owner Best Practice**
   - Typically only ONE person should be marked as Ultimate Owner
   - Represents the top of the organization
   - All others report up the chain to this person

2. **Reporting Chain**
   - Standard hierarchy: Owner → Manager → Group Controller → Entity Controller
   - Can be customized based on organization
   - Can have multiple people at each level

3. **Circular References**
   - System allows A → B → A cycles (database doesn't prevent)
   - Should be avoided in practice
   - Consider adding UI validation in future

4. **Email Uniqueness**
   - Each controller must have unique email
   - Database enforces this with UNIQUE constraint
   - Cannot have duplicate emails

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Old `controllers` table (if existed) is replaced
   - New table structure with reporting hierarchy
   - Migration script handles this safely
