## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Period dropdown shows "No periods available"
**Solution**: Upload trial balance data first with the period field filled.

### Problem: Numbers not showing after clicking Populate
**Causes**:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify trial balance data exists for selected period
3. Ensure GL accounts in trial balance match Chart of Accounts
4. Check that GL accounts have proper class tagging

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for console logs showing:
   - "ðŸ“… Unique periods found: [...]"
   - "ðŸ“Š Data loaded: ..."
   - "âœ… Populated data: ..."
3. Check the counts - if they're 0, data is missing

### Problem: Hierarchy not showing accounts
**Cause**: GL accounts in Chart of Accounts must have matching class_name, subclass_name, note_name, subnote_name fields.

**Solution**:
1. Go to Chart of Accounts page
2. Look for the "GLs with Incomplete Tagging" warning section
3. Complete missing tagging for all GLs

### Problem: Numbers seem wrong
**Check**:
1. Trial balance debit/credit values are correct
2. Entity assignment in trial balance matches entities in system
3. Elimination amounts are correct
4. Class-based calculation logic:
   - Assets/Expenses use Debit - Credit
   - Liabilities/Equity/Revenue use Credit - Debit

## Technical Details

### Database Tables Used:
- `trial_balance`: Entity-level GL data
- `chart_of_accounts`: GL master with hierarchy tagging
- `coa_master_hierarchy`: 4-level hierarchy structure
- `entities`: Entity master data
- `elimination_entries`: Custom elimination journal entries
- `intercompany_transactions`: GL-to-GL elimination mappings
- `adjustment_entries`: Consolidation adjustments

### Field Matching:
Trial balance GL accounts are matched to the hierarchy based on:
- `account_code` matches between trial_balance and chart_of_accounts
- `class_name`, `subclass_name`, `note_name`, `subnote_name` in chart_of_accounts

### Period Format:
- Stored as DATE in database
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-12-31)
- Upload TB with period in this format

## Best Practices

1. **Complete COA Setup First**: Ensure all GL accounts have complete 4-level tagging before uploading trial balance
2. **Use Consistent Period Format**: Always use YYYY-MM-DD format for periods
3. **Validate Eliminations**: Check that elimination mappings are balanced before consolidating
4. **Review Adjustments**: Ensure all consolidation adjustments are properly recorded
5. **Export Regularly**: Export consolidated data for audit trails and reporting

## Next Steps

After viewing consolidated data:
1. Export to Excel for further analysis
2. Go to **Reporting** page to generate formatted financial statements
3. Review elimination details by clicking amounts
4. Adjust eliminations or adjustments as needed
5. Re-populate to see updated numbers
