## API Endpoints

The System Settings feature uses these API endpoints:

### User Management
```
GET    /api/users              - List all users
POST   /api/users/invite       - Invite new user
PUT    /api/users/[userId]     - Update user
DELETE /api/users/[userId]     - Delete user
PATCH  /api/users/[userId]/status - Toggle user status
```

### Company Settings
```
GET /api/company/settings    - Get company settings
PUT /api/company/settings    - Update company settings (primary admin only)
```

### Authentication
All endpoints require:
- Valid session token in cookies
- Admin or Primary Admin role
- Company ID match (multi-tenant isolation)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized - Admin access required"

**Cause**: Your account doesn't have admin permissions.

**Solution**:
- Check your role in the user dropdown (top-right)
- Contact your Primary Admin to upgrade your role

---

### "Cannot modify primary admin"

**Cause**: Trying to edit/delete the primary admin account.

**Solution**:
- Primary admin can only be modified by themselves
- Use a different admin account, or
- Login as the primary admin

---

### "A user with this email already exists"

**Cause**: Email address is already in use in your company.

**Solution**:
- Check the user list - they may already have an account
- Use a different email address
- If the user is inactive, reactivate instead of creating new

---

### User invitation sent but user can't login

**Possible Causes**:
1. User is using wrong username/password
2. User account is deactivated
3. User is locked due to failed attempts

**Solutions**:
1. Verify credentials from invitation response
2. Check user status in user table
3. Check user's `locked_until` field and wait for unlock
4. Reset user password by editing user

---

### "Invalid session" errors

**Cause**: Session expired or invalid.

**Solution**:
- Logout and login again
- Check JWT_SECRET is set in environment
- Verify session_token cookie is present

---

## Best Practices

### User Onboarding

1. ✅ **Invite with appropriate role** - Don't give everyone admin access
2. ✅ **Share credentials securely** - Use password managers or secure messaging
3. ✅ **Verify user logs in** - Check Last Login column
4. ✅ **Monitor failed attempts** - Check audit logs regularly

### Role Assignment

1. ✅ **Follow principle of least privilege** - Start with Viewer, upgrade as needed
2. ✅ **Limit admin accounts** - Only give admin to trusted users
3. ✅ **Review roles quarterly** - Remove access for departing employees
4. ✅ **Document role decisions** - Keep track of why users have certain roles

### Account Hygiene

1. ✅ **Deactivate instead of delete** - Preserve audit trail
2. ✅ **Review inactive users** - Deactivate accounts not used in 90 days
3. ✅ **Monitor last login** - Identify unused accounts
4. ✅ **Clean up test accounts** - Remove development/test users in production

### Security Monitoring

1. ✅ **Review audit logs** - Check for suspicious activity weekly
2. ✅ **Monitor failed logins** - Investigate repeated failures
3. ✅ **Track role changes** - Ensure they're legitimate
4. ✅ **Verify new users** - Confirm all invitations are authorized
