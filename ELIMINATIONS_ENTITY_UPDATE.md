# Eliminations Entity Selection - Update

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### Summary
Made entity selection **mandatory** in the Eliminations page for both template-based and custom eliminations.

---

## 🎯 What Was Changed

### 1. Entity Fields Now Mandatory ✅

**Before:**
- Entity 1: Optional
- Entity 2: Optional
- Only shown for "Start from Scratch" option

**After:**
- Entity 1: **Required** (red asterisk)
- Entity 2: **Required** (red asterisk)
- Shown for **ALL elimination templates**
- Validation enforced on save

---

## 📋 Detailed Changes

### 1. UI Changes

#### Entity 1 Field:
```
Label: "Entity 1 *" (red asterisk for required)
Placeholder: "Select entity 1..."
Helper text: "Sender entity (e.g., selling entity)"
Required: Yes
```

#### Entity 2 Field:
```
Label: "Entity 2 *" (red asterisk for required)
Placeholder: "Select entity 2..."
Helper text: "Receiver entity (e.g., buying entity)"
Required: Yes
Filtered: Cannot select same entity as Entity 1
```

### 2. Validation Rules Added

#### On Save:
1. ✅ **Both entities required**
   - Error: "Please select both Entity 1 and Entity 2. Eliminations must be between two entities."

2. ✅ **Entities must be different**
   - Error: "Entity 1 and Entity 2 must be different entities."

3. ✅ **Name and Period required** (existing)
   - Error: "Please enter elimination name and period."

4. ✅ **All entry fields required** (existing)
   - Error: "Please fill in all entry fields."

5. ✅ **Journal must balance** (existing)
   - Error: "Journal entry is not balanced. Total Debit must equal Total Credit."

### 3. Entity Dropdown Logic

**Entity 1 Dropdown:**
- Shows all active entities
- No filtering

**Entity 2 Dropdown:**
- Shows all active entities EXCEPT Entity 1
- Automatically filters out selected Entity 1
- Prevents duplicate selection

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### 1. **Data Integrity**
- Every elimination is now properly linked to TWO entities
- No orphaned eliminations without entity context
- Clear trail of which entities are involved

### 2. **IFRS Compliance**
- Intercompany eliminations must identify the parties
- Required for consolidation audit trails
- Proper documentation of related-party transactions

### 3. **Reporting & Analysis**
- Can filter eliminations by entity
- Can analyze intercompany activity between specific entities
- Can generate entity-specific elimination reports

### 4. **Validation Support**
- System can check if trial balance exists for selected entities
- Can validate account balances against entity TB
- Can warn about insufficient balances

### 5. **User Experience**
- Clear which entities are involved
- Helper text guides users (sender vs receiver)
- Cannot select same entity twice (dropdown filters)

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Tip 1: Entity Order Matters
- **Entity 1** = Sender/Source (e.g., selling entity)
- **Entity 2** = Receiver/Destination (e.g., buying entity)
- Keep consistent for better reporting

### Tip 2: Common Patterns
```
Revenue-COGS:
  Entity 1 = Seller (recognizes revenue)
  Entity 2 = Buyer (recognizes COGS)

Payables-Receivables:
  Entity 1 = Debtor (has payable)
  Entity 2 = Creditor (has receivable)

Investment-Equity:
  Entity 1 = Parent (has investment)
  Entity 2 = Subsidiary (has equity)
```

### Tip 3: Entity Selection
- Select entities before entering amounts
- System can validate against entity trial balances
- Gets better balance warnings
